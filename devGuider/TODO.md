# TODO: Enhance Timetable Generation Algorithm

## Tasks
- [ ] Modify assignment logic to identify sections between breaks per day
- [ ] For each section: if even periods, assign double periods of different subjects; if odd, assign doubles and leave one slot
- [ ] Assign subjects: doubles for even-parity periods, singles for odd-parity to leftover slots
- [ ] Prevent more than 2 consecutive periods of the same subject
- [ ] Test the updated generation and verify constraints

## Progress
- [x] Analyzed requirements and planned changes
- [x] Confirmed plan with user
